# Investigating negative interference in meta-learning across NLP tasks - Pragmatics and social meaning
Project for the UvA course on Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics.



## How to run
Train the model by executing
```python classify_emotion.py```
with optional command line arguments for hyperparameters.



## Code structure
```data.py```: Used for loading datasets.  
```model.py```: Defines the BERT model.  
```classify_emotion.py```: Contains code for training the BERT model.



## TO DO:
